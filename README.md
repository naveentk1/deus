> A modern terminal emulator written in C++

**deus** is a terminal emulator focused on performance and simplicity. Built from scratch to understand how terminals work under the hoodâ€”from pseudo-terminal management to ANSI escape sequence parsing to hardware-accelerated rendering.

## Features

- Full VT100/ANSI escape sequence support
- Hardware-accelerated rendering with OpenGL
- Multi-threaded architecture for responsive UI
- 256-color and true color (24-bit) support
- Efficient scrollback buffer management


## Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - Basic terminal emulation is functional. Currently implementing advanced features like tabs, splits, and configuration support.
